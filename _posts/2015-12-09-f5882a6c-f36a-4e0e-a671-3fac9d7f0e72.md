When Steve Jobs told his colleagues at Apple not to ask "What would Steve do?" he was extending them the permission and expectation that they would take the principles that made Apple a world-changing company and apply them themselves. That they should always Think Different, not try to follow an algorithm.

Yet recently it seems clear to many of us that Apple has forgotten how to do great things, that the products are starting to have the same design compromises that every pother tech company suffer with.

What Steve forgot to tell his colleagues was "I don't want you to try to figure out what to do by asking what I would have done, but neither should should you ship anything you know I would have was crap."
